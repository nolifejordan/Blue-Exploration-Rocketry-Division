Blue Exploration and Rocketry Division (BERD) is a stockalike Blue Origin mod, providing several parts for recreating Blue Origin rockets and spacecraft. Currently it has the parts for New Glenn (New Schirra). Following updates will include New Shepard, Blue Ring, Blue Moon, and more from Blue Origin

KSP AERODYNAMICS IS FUNKY! AS A RESULT, THE CANARDS ARE INITIALLY UPSIDE DOWN. THIS MEANS YOU NEED TO FLIP IT OVER FOR IT TO BE IN THE CORRECT ORIENTATION ON NEW GLENN
