	@manufacturer = Blue Origin
	@title = BE-3U Liquid Cryogenic Vacuum Engine
	@description = The BE-3U is BIG, it is efficient, and it comes in pairs because that is how you do it when you are serious. These engines push the second stage like you would not believe, smooth, clean, very controlled. Some people said two was too much, I said no, two is perfect, and I was right. Fantastic engines, tremendous performance.

	@title = Upgraded BE-4 Liquid Methane Engine
	@description = The BE-4 is a state of the art methalox engine and believe me it is a POWERHOUSE. People come up to me all the time and they say wow that engine is strong and they are right. Incredible thrust, incredible reliability, and it relights beautifully because it was built right from the start. I know engines, I know rockets, and this is one of the best booster engines ever made. Period.
