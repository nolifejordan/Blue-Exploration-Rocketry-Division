	description = This engine skirt is wide, strong, and built entirely for reuse. Wider than the tank, room for seven engines and six landing legs, protected by KOMET and a state of the art heat shield. It takes the heat, it takes the load, and it comes back ready. This is how you build a booster that keeps flying.
