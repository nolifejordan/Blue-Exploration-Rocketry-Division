	description = These strakes are bigger and better than anyone else’s strakes, that is just a fact. Nickel alloy on the edges, KOMET thermal protection on the surfaces, very tough, very advanced. They generate huge lift on descent and they survive heat that would destroy lesser hardware. People see these and they say wow, those are some strakes.
