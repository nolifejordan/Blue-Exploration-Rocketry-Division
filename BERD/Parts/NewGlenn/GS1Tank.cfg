	description = The GS1 first stage tank is absolutely YUUUGE. It is beefy, it is tall, and it towers over other wimpy boosters, no contest. Built to hold enormous amounts of propellant and built for reuse, this tank dominates from the moment it rolls out. People see it and they know it means business.
