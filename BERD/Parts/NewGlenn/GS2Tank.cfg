	title = New Schirra Second Stage Cryogenic Tank
	manufacturer = Corvid Aerospace
	description = This tank is the largest upper stage tank out there, everybody knows it. Huge capacity, very efficient, wrapped in SOFI insulation to keep everything inside nice and chill. This tank lets the second stage go far, go fast, and go reliably. I have seen a lot of upper stages, this one stands out.
